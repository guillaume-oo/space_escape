GOAL AND CONTEXT
In this mini demo game, you incarnate a astronaut travelling from planet to planet into space. In this reduced scope, you can walk only one planet has been created, your goal is to collect the fragments of the map of the galaxy. Three fragments have been added on this map (even if more could easily be added). Those fragments are numbered after the Fiboncci suite numbers.
After walking around and collecting the fragment, you can use the spaceship to leave the planet. You first need to hover at a high enough distance from the planet before to be able to navigate freely.
Once using the ship, you can fire projectiles to destroy obstacles (Asteroids).

CONTROLS:
  - Tab: open inventory
  - WASD: move
  - Mouse: Look around
  - E: collect item
  - U: use/enter/exit spaceship
  - Space: Hover Up (when using the spaceship)
  - Left Shift: Hover Down (when using the spaceship)
  - Left Click: shoot (when using the spaceship)

CHOICES:
As i am still new to unity, i decided to try to focus on exploring the field of possibilities rather than to focus on the visual experience and UX. So, instead of spending too much time creating beatiful 3D models with detailed textures, or building a pretty user interface (such as the buttons on mobile), or having a nicer variety and quality of sound effetcs, i spent more time on trying to understand some concepts such as Ray Tracing, how to define controls ( i had to change in the middle of the project as i was using the old input system. Switching to the new one has been a bit of a hassle...)
Adding the possibility to use the spaceship and fire ennemies with it was also a way for me to explore possibilities and learn more, even though it didn't add much to the game at this stage.
Instead of having a fun or pretty game to play, i decided to try to reach for a game with more possibilities. Now that i know how to paint assets on a surface, how to switch player and telport player (by using the spaceship) and interact with items and collision boxes, i believe that i have a good small toolbox and that adding more planets, with a better environment and better graphics etc... could be easily be improved with time.

NON EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF IMPROVMENTS TO BE DONE:
  - Have more updates of the text instructions on screen. 
  - Improve size and precision of collision boxes: Especially on trees, i am aware that they are too big which makes walking around unconvenent
  - Add collision boxes to more items: such as the Japanese gates, the tables that holds the fragments...
  - Create icons for inventory items
  - Create better SVGs for player controls on mobile
  - Have smoother player movements and more adjusted speed values
  - Add health bar on ennemies
  - exiting the spaceship should be possible only when the spaceship is close enough tp a planet
  - The fire button on mobile should use the 'on hold' triggering parameter 
  - Add more sound effects
  - Improve sound effects quality and mastering levels
  - Improve shading and textures
  - Build more optimized models
  - Add more variety in model assets (for decor)
  - Use particles to have animated decor
